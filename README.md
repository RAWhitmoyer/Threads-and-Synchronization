# Threads and Syncronization
 This program uses built in threading and synchronization support in Java. The program itself is made up of 6 threads: 3 of which produce data, 2 of which process the data, and 1 that displays the data. The first of the 3 data producing threads prompts the user for 3 numbers, the second generates 10,000,000 random numbers using Java's random number generator, and the third retrieves 100,000 random numbers from Random.org (note that Random.org only allows a user to generate a limited number of random numbers within a certain time period). All of the numbers produced must be between 1 and 1,000,000,000 and are entered into the same finite buffer. Both of the data processing threads filter the data for potential prime numbers. Any number divisible by a prime number less than 100 is ignored. All of the remaining numbers are considered potential primes. Finally, the remaining thread displays all potential primes that made it through the filters.
